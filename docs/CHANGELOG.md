## [2025-06-29] - Task Execution System Implementation

### Added
- **Task Execution Engine** (`src/executor/execution.ts`)
  - Implemented `TaskExecutor` class for executing mapped tasks with dependency handling
  - Added support for parallel and sequential task execution based on dependency analysis
  - Integrated context passing from dependent steps to dependent tasks
  - Added comprehensive execution reporting and error handling
  - Implemented proper integration with Tool Agent for "Agent" action types

- **Enhanced Execution Prompt** (`src/llm/prompts/execution.ts`)
  - Created comprehensive execution prompt for Tool Agent
  - Added context awareness and integration guidelines
  - Included structured response format and task execution principles
  - Added research-first approach and quality focus guidelines

- **Complete Workflow Execution** (`src/main.ts`)
  - Added `executeWorkflow()` function for end-to-end task execution
  - Implemented user choice menu for different execution modes
  - Added complete workflow from planning → structuring → mapping → execution
  - Enhanced user interface with progress indicators and status updates

### Modified
- **Export Interfaces** (`src/executor/mapping.ts`)
  - Exported `ExecutionPlan` and `ExecutionGroup` interfaces for use by execution module
  - Enhanced interface accessibility for modular architecture

### Technical Details
- **Dependency Management**: Tasks with dependencies receive context from completed dependent steps
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks without dependencies or at the same dependency level execute in parallel
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed reporting and graceful failure handling
- **Context Passing**: Outputs from dependent steps are automatically passed as context to dependent tasks
- **Tool Integration**: When action type is "Agent", the system calls the Tool Agent with enhanced context

### Features
- Real-time execution progress with visual indicators
- Detailed execution reports including timing and success/failure status
- Automatic dependency validation before execution
- Context-aware task execution with previous step outputs
- Parallel processing optimization for independent tasks
